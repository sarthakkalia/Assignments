    "**Lasso Regression:**\n",
    "- Lasso Regression is a type of linear regression that includes a regularization term to prevent overfitting and perform feature selection.\n",
    "- It adds a penalty term to the ordinary least squares (OLS) cost function, proportional to the absolute values of the coefficients.\n",
    "- The Lasso cost function is \\(\\text{Cost}_{\\text{Lasso}} = \\text{OLS cost} + \\lambda \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |\\beta_i|\\), where \\(\\lambda\\) is the regularization parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Differences from Other Regression Techniques:**\n",
    "- **Feature Selection:** Lasso tends to drive some coefficients exactly to zero, effectively performing feature selection. This is in contrast to Ridge Regression, which shrinks coefficients but rarely sets them exactly to zero.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **L1 Regularization:** Lasso uses L1 regularization, penalizing the absolute values of coefficients, while Ridge uses L2 regularization, penalizing the squared values of coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Impact on Coefficients:** Lasso encourages sparsity in the model by setting some coefficients to zero, leading to a simpler and more interpretable model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Handling Multicollinearity:** Lasso can be sensitive to multicollinearity, and in the presence of highly correlated features, it may arbitrarily select one and set others to zero.\n",

    "In short, Lasso Regression introduces sparsity through feature selection by driving some coefficients to zero, making it useful when dealing with high-dimensional data or when a simpler model is desired."
