    "**Linear Regression:**\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Linear regression is used for predicting a continuous outcome variable. It establishes a linear relationship between the independent variables and the continuous dependent variable.\n",
    "- **Output:** The output of linear regression is a continuous value. It predicts the value of the dependent variable based on the input features.\n",
    "- **Example:** Predicting house prices based on features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and location.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logistic Regression:**\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Logistic regression is used for binary or multi-class classification problems. It models the probability of an instance belonging to a particular class.\n",
    "- **Output:** The output of logistic regression is a probability score between 0 and 1. It uses the logistic function (sigmoid) to map the linear combination of input features to a probability value.\n",
    "- **Example:** Predicting whether an email is spam or not spam based on features like the presence of certain keywords, sender information, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario for Logistic Regression:**\n",
    "Consider a scenario where you want to predict whether a student will pass or fail an exam based on the number of hours they studied. This is a binary classification problem (pass/fail), making logistic regression more appropriate than linear regression. Linear regression could provide predictions outside the 0-1 range, which doesn't make sense for a binary outcome. Logistic regression, on the other hand, models the probability of passing the exam given the number of hours studied and ensures that the predicted probabilities are within the valid range [0, 1]."
