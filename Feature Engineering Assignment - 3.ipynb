    "Data encoding is the process of converting data from one form to another. In the context of data science, it is often used to represent information in a format that is suitable for storage, transmission, or analysis. Common types of data encoding include text encoding (e.g., ASCII, UTF-8), numeric encoding, and categorical encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "In data science, data encoding is useful for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Standardization:** Encoding helps standardize data formats, making it easier to handle and process data consistently across different systems and platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Compression:** Encoding can reduce the size of data, making it more efficient for storage and transmission. This is particularly important when dealing with large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Security:** Encoding can be used for encrypting sensitive information, providing a level of security by converting data into a format that is not easily readable without the proper decoding key.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Machine Learning:** In machine learning, features often need to be encoded into numerical representations for algorithms to process them effectively. This includes encoding categorical variables, such as converting text labels into numerical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, data encoding is a crucial aspect of data science that facilitates data processing, storage, and analysis by transforming information into a more suitable and standardized format."

    "   - **Justification:** Nominal encoding assigns unique numerical labels to each category without implying any ordinal relationship. This is useful when the order among categories is not significant. For example, encoding species names (e.g., cat, dog) or habitat types (e.g., forest, desert) using nominal encoding would be appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Ordinal Encoding:**\n",
    "   - **When to use:** If there is a meaningful order or ranking among the categories, such as a hierarchy or scale (e.g., low, medium, high for diet), ordinal encoding may be more appropriate.\n",
    "   - **Justification:** Ordinal encoding assigns numerical values based on the order or rank of categories. For example, if the diet categories have a clear hierarchy like \"herbivore,\" \"omnivore,\" \"carnivore,\" ordinal encoding could capture this information effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice between nominal and ordinal encoding depends on the characteristics of your categorical variables and the specific requirements of your machine learning algorithm.

    "In this scenario, you have a mix of categorical and numerical features. For categorical features like \"gender\" and \"contract type,\" you would need to use encoding techniques to convert them into numerical representations. Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Identify Categorical Features\n",
    "Identify which features are categorical. In this case, \"gender\" and \"contract type\" are categorical.\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Ordinal Encoding:** If there is a meaningful order in categories (e.g., \"month-to-month,\" \"one year,\" and \"two years\" for contract type).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Apply Encoding\n",
    "#### For Gender (Nominal Encoding):\n",
    "Use one-hot encoding since there is no inherent order between male and female.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "# Assuming df is your DataFrame\n",
    "df_encoded = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=['gender'], prefix='gender', drop_first=True)\n",
    "```\n",

    "This will create two columns, \"gender_male\" and \"gender_female,\" with binary values indicating the gender.\n",

    "#### For Contract Type (Ordinal Encoding):\n",
    "If there is a meaningful order in contract types, you can map them to numerical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Assuming df is your DataFrame\n",
    "contract_mapping = {'month-to-month': 1, 'one year': 2, 'two year': 3}\n",
    "df['contract_type_encoded'] = df['contract_type'].map(contract_mapping)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you have a new column \"contract_type_encoded\" with numerical values representing the ordinal nature of contract types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Verify and Use\n",
    "Verify that the encoding has been applied correctly by checking the transformed DataFrame. Now, you can use the encoded features in your machine learning model to predict customer churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Display the transformed DataFrame\n",
    "print(df_encoded)\n",
    "```\n",
