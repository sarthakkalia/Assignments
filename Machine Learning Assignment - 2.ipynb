As a result, the model performs exceptionally well on the training data but poorly on unseen or test data. The consequences of overfitting include poor generalization, high variance, and a lack of ability to make accurate predictions on new data.\n",

    "- Bias (Underfitting): Bias refers to the error introduced by approximating a real-world problem (which may be complex) with a simplified model. High bias leads to underfitting, where the model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data. Underfit models have low training and test performance.\n",
