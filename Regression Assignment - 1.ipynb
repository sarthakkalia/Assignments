    "Linear regression makes several assumptions about the underlying data. It's important to check these assumptions to ensure the validity and reliability of the regression analysis. The key assumptions of linear regression are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Linearity: The relationship between the independent variable(s) and the dependent variable is assumed to be linear. This means that changes in the independent variable(s) are associated with constant changes in the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Independence of Residuals: The residuals (the differences between observed and predicted values) should be independent. In other words, the value of the residual for one data point should not predict the value of the residual for another data point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Homoscedasticity: The variance of the residuals should be constant across all levels of the independent variable(s). This implies that the spread of the residuals should remain roughly the same as you move along the predicted values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normality of Residuals: The residuals should be approximately normally distributed. This assumption is not crucial for large sample sizes due to the Central Limit Theorem, but for smaller samples, it is beneficial if the residuals are close to normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "No Perfect Multicollinearity: In multiple linear regression, the independent variables should not be perfectly correlated. High correlations between independent variables can lead to issues in estimating the individual contributions of each variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check these assumptions, you can use various diagnostic tools and statistical tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "Residual Plots: Plotting the residuals against the predicted values can help identify patterns that violate assumptions. A scatter plot should ideally show a random distribution of points around zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normality Tests: Statistical tests like the Shapiro-Wilk test or visual inspection of a histogram and Q-Q plot of residuals can assess the normality assumption.\n",

    "**Concept:**\n",
    "Multicollinearity occurs when two or more independent variables in a multiple linear regression model are highly correlated with each other. This can pose a problem because it undermines the ability to isolate the individual effects of each independent variable on the dependent variable. High multicollinearity can lead to inflated standard errors, making it difficult to identify which variables are significantly contributing to the model.\n",

    "**Detection:**\n",
    "Common methods to detect multicollinearity include:\n",
    "1. **Correlation Matrix:** Check the correlation matrix for high correlation coefficients between pairs of independent variables.\n",
    "2. **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF):** Calculate the VIF for each independent variable. VIF measures how much the variance of an estimated regression coefficient increases if the variables are correlated. A high VIF (usually above 10) suggests multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Addressing Multicollinearity:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Remove Highly Correlated Variables:**\n",
    "   - Identify and remove one of the variables in highly correlated pairs if they represent similar information.\n",
    "   - Prioritize variables based on domain knowledge or importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Engineering:**\n",
    "   - Create composite variables or interaction terms that combine the information from correlated variables.\n",

    "3. **Data Collection:**\n",
    "   - Collect more data to reduce the impact of multicollinearity.\n",

    "4. **Regularization Techniques:**\n",
    "   - Techniques like Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression include regularization terms that penalize large coefficients, mitigating the impact of multicollinearity.\n",

    "5. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):**\n",
    "   - Use PCA to transform the original correlated variables into a set of linearly uncorrelated variables (principal components). However, the interpretability of the original variables is lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Partial Least Squares (PLS):**\n",

Careful consideration of the trade-offs and model evaluation is essential."
