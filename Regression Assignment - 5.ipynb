    "Elastic Net Regression is a type of linear regression that combines features of both L1 regularization (Lasso) and L2 regularization (Ridge). It is designed to address some of the limitations of these individual regularization techniques. The regularization terms in Elastic Net are added to the ordinary least squares (OLS) objective function to penalize large coefficients and prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective function of Elastic Net Regression is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\text{Minimize} \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{2N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - \\beta_0 - \\sum_{j=1}^{p} x_{ij}\\beta_j)^2 + \\lambda_1 \\sum_{j=1}^{p} |\\beta_j| + \\lambda_2 \\sum_{j=1}^{p} \\beta_j^2 \\right\\} \\]\n",

    "Elastic Net differs from other regression techniques, such as Ridge and Lasso, in that it combines both L1 and L2 regularization. This combination allows Elastic Net to handle situations where there are a large number of features, some of which may be highly correlated. The L1 penalty encourages sparsity in the model by setting some coefficients to exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection. The L2 penalty, on the other hand, tends to shrink the coefficients towards zero without necessarily setting them exactly to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key differences from other regression techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization):**\n",
    "   - Only includes the squared magnitude of coefficients in the penalty term.\n",
    "   - Tends to shrink coefficients toward zero, but rarely exactly to zero.\n",
    "   - Useful when dealing with multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization):**\n",
    "   - Only includes the absolute magnitude of coefficients in the penalty term.\n",
    "   - Encourages sparsity by setting some coefficients exactly to zero.\n",
    "   - Useful for feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Elastic Net Regression:**\n",
    "   - Combines both L1 and L2 penalties.\n",
    "   - Provides a balance between Ridge and Lasso, incorporating the advantages of both.\n",
    "   - Suitable for datasets with high dimensionality and multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net allows for more flexibility in selecting relevant features while addressing the limitations of each individual regularization technique. The choice between Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net often depends on the specific characteristics of the dataset and the goals of the modeling task."

The values that lead to the best performance (e.g., the lowest validation error) are considered the optimal regularization parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, the common approach is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Grid Search or Random Search:**\n",
    "   - Define a grid or a random set of values for \\( \\lambda_1 \\) and \\( \\lambda_2 \\).\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Handles Multicollinearity:**\n",
    "   - Effective in situations where there is multicollinearity among predictor variables.\n",

    "   - The optimization problem involving both L1 and L2 penalties is computationally more intensive compared to Ridge or Lasso alone.\n",

    "3. **Tuning Parameters:**\n",

    "5. **Sensitive to Scaling:**\n",
